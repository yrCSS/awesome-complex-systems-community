# How to contribute

Anyone is welcome to contribute! You can do so either directly by submitting changes to
the
[`README`](https://github.com/yrCSS/awesome-complex-systems-community/blob/main/README.md)
in a [pull
request](https://github.com/yrCSS/awesome-complex-systems-community/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc),
or by starting a discussion in a new
[issue](https://github.com/yrCSS/awesome-complex-systems-community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
If you're not familiar with pull requests, you can either make it from a fork, following
the detailed instruction from [this Stack Overflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14680805), or more simply use GitHub's web
interface to make one, as explained in [this other
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61152349).
